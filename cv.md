## About Me ##
She started her career as a PPS manager in 2016. Mastered new hard and soft skills, learning new services for advertising launch and analytics, as well as immersing herself in the professional world of advertising and marketing.

At the moment I work at the programmatic platform as an AdOps manager. I like my job, but I always think about the future, about my development as a professional. This year I decided to study front-end development in order to create promotional materials for advertisers.

Implement an isLeapYear() function that determines if a year is a leap year or not. The year will be a leap year if it is a multiple (divided without a remainder) by 400, or it is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 100 at the same time.

    const isLeapYear = (year) => {
      const result = (year % 400 === 0) || (year % 100 !== 0 && year % 4 === 0);
      return result;
    }
